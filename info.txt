Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - codeigniter4/framework[4.0.0, ..., v4.1.9] require ext-intl * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's intl extension.
    - Root composer.json requires codeigniter4/framework ^4 -> satisfiable by codeigniter4/framework[4.0.0, ..., v4.1.9].

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - C:\xampp\php\php.ini
You can also run `php --ini` inside terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
